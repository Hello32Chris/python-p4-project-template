Create  a route that filters through transactions by store -- non-restful routing
 - A company has man ygoods services a user might be linked to the goods they purchased only by a transaction 

GOALS:

CREATE A ROUTE for transactions only belonging to one client so the client can see their history as well as the store can as well possibly

- GET transaction by client_id ^^^^^^^^^
- Start creating front end :))))
